# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
a systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering involves development of software systems while traditional programming involves writing code to create specific instruction for a computur to follow.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
this involves steps/phases used in the development of a system:
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
requirement gathering- gathering of user needs and requirements for the system
design- where developers do all the designs eg user interface
implementation- writing of code and creating the software
testing- phase where software testing is done.
deployment- releasing software to users
maintenance- this include update and changes done to the system after deployment
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
agile is an iteractive and incremental approach while waterfall is a sequential approach with phases.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
agile is an iteractive and incremental approach while waterfall is a sequential approach with phases.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
it is the process of defining,documenting and maintaining the requirements for a software system.
gathering requirement- gather the needs and expectations of clients/stakeholders
analysis- determine which requirements are most critical.
specification- create clear and detailed requirements specification.
 verification- regularly reviewing requirements with users and team members.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
modality refers to the design principle of dividing a software system into distint, self-contained units or modules, each of which performs a specific part of the system's functionality.
its benefits include: enhances scalability, improves maintainability, reusability, flexibility and adaptability.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing- this is testing of individual modules of the software.
integration testing- testing of the interactions between diffrent components of the system.
system testing- testing of the whole system.
acceptance testing- testing of system againist user requirements.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
this is a tool that helps manage changes to sorse code over time.it enables many developers to collabaorate on a project. eg github,git
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
roles of software project manager include: planning,resource management and risk management some challenges include: uncordination of the team, lack of proper time management
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
maintenance involves the modifying and updating of software after its deployment. some of the types include:
corrective maintenace-  done to fix errors found after software has been released.
adaptive maintenance- modifying software to accommodate changes in its evironment e.g os change.
preventive maintenance- involves updating the software to prevent issues e.g security issues
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
privacy- ensuring user privacy is maintained
security- issues of hacking  are a huge risk
fairness- avaoiding discrimination and ensuring fairness
how software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards
following code of ethics
training of ethical issues and security issues.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
